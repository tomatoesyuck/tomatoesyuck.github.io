so what did i do at amazon? <br>

- refactored code for Kindle's iOS In-book top chrome and overflow <small> ( shown below just in case you're not familiar with kindle )</small>

- new implementation only needed about half as many lines of code as original implementation
- allowed for live updating of the buttons
- localized my buttons (accessibility is good)
- wrote design docs

- sat in on sprint meetings
