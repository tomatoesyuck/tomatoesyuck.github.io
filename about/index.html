If you haven't noticed yet, my name is Andrea! I'm based in NYC. I like a mix of software/mobile development and design. Being adaptable is my second nature. 
<br><br>
For my projects, humans are at the forefront of my thought process (since, after all, I make things for people to use). Anything I do takes into consider the consumer's experience. So I hope you had a fun time around here. 
<br><br>
Other than that, know a good dessert shop? (I have a massive sweet tooth.) Think tomatoes are good? (Go ahead, try and give me a good argument.) Feel free to contact me for any of those or any other reason. I won't bite, I promise.
